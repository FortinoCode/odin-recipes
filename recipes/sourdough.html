    <h2>What Even Is Sourdough?</h2>
        <p>Sourdough is a style of bread created by using a <a href=starter.html>starter</a> instead of store bought yeast. While more of a time commitment than a straight dough, sourdough makes up for it with a deep flavor profile.</p>

                <li>Feed your <a href="starter.html">starter</a></li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Evening of Day 1</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour 390g warm water into a large mixing bowl</li>
                <li>Add 500g of all purpose flour to the water</li>
                <li>Mix by hand until just combined and let rest for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Add 60g of active starter and 10g of salt to the mixture</li>
                <li>Mix by hand until fully incorporated</li>
                <li>Use your fingers to break apart any large clumps of flour</li>
                <li>Transfer to a separate bowl or proofing bin and let rest for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Perform a series of five stretch and folds</li>
                <li>Repeat steps seven and eight three more times</li>
                <li>Cover your dough and let proof over night (8-12 hours)</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Morning of Day 2</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Check your dough to see if it has doubled in size. Don't worry if it hasn't, just let it proof for a bit longer</li>
                <li>Once dough has doubled in size, transfer to a lightly floured counter top</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg" target="_blank">Shape your dough</a> and place in a floured banneton</li>
                <li>Allow your shaped dough to proof for another two to four hours (if you are unsure if your dough has finished proofing you may perform the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o5boRXTlt0&t=11s" target="_blank">poke test</a>)</li>
                <li>While your dough is proofing, place your dutch oven into your oven and preheat to at least 500&deg;F for a minimum of one hour</li>
                <li>Gently transfer the dough from the banneton to a floured surface and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C75kZLdi61k" target="_blank">score it</a></li>
                <li>Carefully transfer the scored dough to your dutch oven, cover it, and place into your oven</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to 475&deg;F and bake covered for 20 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove the lid from the dutch oven and continue to bake for another 25 minutes or until the loaf is a deep brown</li>
                <li>Remove your finished bread from the dutch oven and place on a wire rack to cool for at least a half hour</li>
            </ol>
