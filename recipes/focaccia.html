    <h2>What Even Is Focaccia?</h2>
        <p>Focaccia is a classic leavened Italian bread perfect for sandwiches or as a side! This recipe will use rosemary, but focaccia is great for topping experimentation!</p>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Thermometer</li>
            <li>Digital kitchen scale</li>
            <li>Large proofing bowl or bin</li>
            <li>Wire cooling rack</li>
            <li>Cast iron pan</li>
            <li>Proofing bag</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g All Purpose flour</li>
            <li>400g Water</li>
            <li>10g Salt</li>
            <li>75g Olive oil</li>
            <li>Additional olive oil for topping</li>
            <li>Three sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>Additional salt for topping</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add flour and warm water (aim for roughly 90-95&deg;F) to your mixing bowl and mix until just combined</li>
            <li>Let rest for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Add olive oil and salt and mix thoroughly (your dough will be sticky and wet, this is good!)</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to your proofing bin and let rest for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Perform a series of five stretch and folds</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the next two hours (five total stretch and folds). You should notice your dough is becoming stronger after each series of folds!</li>
            <li>Allow dough to double in size</li>
            <li>Transfer to a well oiled cast iron</li>
            <li>Using your hands gently spread your dough until it fills the pan</li>
            <li>Place cast iron into a proofing bag</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475&deg;F and finely chop your rosemary leaves</li>
            <li>After the dough has once again doubled in size drizzle your dough with olive oil, give it a light dusting of salt, and sprinkle rosemary across it</li>
            <li>Finally, dimple your dough and place into the oven</li>
            <li>Bake for around 30 minutes or until dough is a golden brown</li>
            <li>Carefully remove from your cast iron pan and transfer to a cooling rack</li>
            <li>Let sit for at least thirty minutes and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
